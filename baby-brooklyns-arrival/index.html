They weren’t super strong and felt just like the Braxton Hicks that I had been experiencing for the last 2 months. The contractions stopped after an hour and I went to bed with the nagging feeling like I needed to finish packing my hospital bag- but I didn’t.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Jan 25<sup>th</sup> – 37w6d</strong></p><p>My water broke at 12:06am. I woke Jack up from a deep sleep and told him to start gathering a few things because I didn’t have everything ready to go (procrastination much?) I felt about 10 pounds lighter after my water broke and it was such a relief. After running around like chickens with our heads cut off for a half hour, we were on our way to the hospital. I had big plans for my “last meal” as I knew that I would be induced at 39 weeks (Feb 2<sup>nd</sup>). I wanted a big IHOP breakfast and I was going to stuff my face. Instead, I was eating a PB&amp;J and chugging a protein drink before the HANGER set in.</p><p> </p><p><strong>12:40am</strong></p><p>We were immediately admitted into L&amp;D because it was extremely obvious that my water broke and I was in labor. Yay for skipping triage! My contractions were irregular and not very strong, but I was dilated 3cm and fully effaced so we were on our way. The hours pasted by quickly, but every check showed that I hadn’t made much progress on my own. We tried walking the hallways and the peanut ball, but no luck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>3:30am</strong></p><p>I was told that it would be good to get started with a batch of Pitocin. I was at 3.5cm and the contractions were starting to get stronger, but still bearable. I heard horror stories of how painful contractions were with Pitocin so I told my nurse that I needed an epidural before we started the medication. The epidural was done about an hour later and it was wonderful. Advice for first time moms: EPIDURALS DON’T HURT. Seriously! I felt the smallest amount of pressure and that was it. Shortly after that, we started the Pitocin.</p><p> </p><p><strong>8:00am</strong></p><p>My contractions became very regular after the medication. I could feel deep pressure during every contraction and it gradually became more painful (epidurals take away sharp pain- not pressure).</p><p> </p><p><strong>9:30am</strong></p><p>At this point I was dilated to a 4.5, getting tired, and discouraged. The pressure was so intense and often at this point that I felt like I couldn’t do it. I thought I had hours ahead of me before I was ready to push. I apologized to my mom for what she was about to hear because I needed some intense pop punk music to get me through each contraction. Jack turned up some A Day To Remember and is gave me just enough motivation to make it through each contraction every two minutes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>10:15am</strong></p><p>This is when I really started to doubt myself. I cried when Jack would tell me that another contraction was coming because I feared that deep pressure. Everyone says it feels like you need to poop- no, no – it feels like a bowling ball needs to come out of your butt. But surprise surprise! I was dilated to a 10! Now all of that pressure made sense. The nurse said the baby’s head was low and we would start pushing at 10:30am. My confidence came back at this point and I felt like I was ready to do this.</p><p> </p><p><strong>10:47am</strong></p><p>I pushed 6 times before baby Brooklyn made her appearance and the moment that they laid her on my chest I forgot about all of the pain. 6 pounds 7 ounces, 18.5 inches long, cone head and all! My doctor made the comment that my placenta was beat up and looked like a 42 week placenta. No surprise! My body beat that thing up like nothing else week after week. I started having flash backs to all of the fertility clinic visits, the day that I found out that I was pregnant, and all of the ER trips. So many emotions flooded my mind and everything felt so surreal. I couldn’t believe that we made it through this pregnancy. Brooklyn Elaine is a true miracle.</p><p> </p><h4>HERE IS A LIST OF THINGS THAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT LABOR, RECOVERY AND HAVING A NEWBORN.</h4><ul><li>Once your water breaks, it doesn’t stop. It will continue to come out with every contraction. My advice: have some adult diapers on hand to wear on your way to the hospital. Life saver!</li><li>Your IV will make you swell! Duh, pumping your body full of more fluid!</li><li>Bring your own pillow! I was so much more comfortable because of this and I slept way better during recovery.</li><li>You thought you were tired during your pregnancy? Um no. You will be more exhausted than you’ve ever been in your entire life. Just be prepared with a stock pile of caffeinated beverages.</li><li>Finally, taking care of a little person is freaking hard! But, holding your baby that you created and carried over the last nine months is so rewarding. A friend of mine gave me this advice and it couldn’t be more true.</li></ul><p>Aerosmith sums up the infant stage so nicely by saying “Don’t want to close my eyes … and I don’t want to miss a thing” Don’t close your eyes. Memorize her sweet sounds, expressions, and scent. This is such a sacred and special time for the three of you.</p></div><footer class="u-innerwrap"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/tags/baby/">baby</a></li><li><a href="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/tags/birth/">birth</a></li><li><a href="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/tags/brooklyn/">Brooklyn</a></li><li><a href="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/tags/story/">story</a></li></ul><div class="post__bio"><h3 class="u-h5"><a href="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/authors/katie-parker/" class="inverse" title="Katie Parker">Katie Parker</a></h3></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/count-your-many-blessings/" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/media/posts/8/responsive/vNE8214NS9GOvXOy7DCu_DSC_0266-605x402-xs.jpeg" data-srcset="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/media/posts/8/responsive/vNE8214NS9GOvXOy7DCu_DSC_0266-605x402-xs.jpeg" data-expand="300" alt=""><div class="post__nav__text">Previous Post<h5>COUNT YOUR MANY BLESSINGS</h5></div></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/katiejoparker/" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/katiejoparker4/" aria-label="Pinterest"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Check out my Instagram for the latest and greatest.</p><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=3b94d4998f24c4cebb952de3a9b15b22"></script></body></html>

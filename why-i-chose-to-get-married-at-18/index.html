I had so many rude remarks and judgments placed against me. People told me that I didn’t understand love; I was too young to know what love is. I was told that I was making a bad decision by giving away my teenage years just to become a wife.</p><p>What people didn’t understand is that a wife is all I have ever wanted to be. Heck, I don’t even have a particular career field that I want to go in because my plan is to be a mom. I didn’t want to live the typical college student life; I didn’t care for parties, or staying up all night with roommates. And what so many people didn’t understand is that when I found Jack, it was so obvious that I was supposed to marry him. It just happened, I knew that this was the man that I would spend eternity with.</p><p>I enjoy cooking meals for my husband, I enjoy folding our laundry, and I love cuddling on the couch discovering new series on Netflix that we then binge watch for the next month. I was done with all of the gossipy girls and talking about each other negatively. It’s so satisfying to know that I have someone on my side that will always have my back and thinks the world of me.</p><p>Additional Plus: I married someone who was done with college. I cannot express how wonderful it has been to marry someone who already has a stable job and doesn’t have to balance a job, classes, and our relationship. I see so many couples who struggle trying to get through college together, and I’m not saying that it is impossible, but it makes things a little more complicated.</p><p>An update on our Marriage: Jack and I have now been married for a year and two months, and I am very happy with how I see our relationship grow through challenges and blessings. We have seen so many blessings from our Heavenly Father lately resulting in us growing closer together. We recently put in an offer on a house and it was accepted, so we are now in the processes of buying a home. We are looking forward to trying to start a family in the near future in our new home!</p></div><footer class="u-innerwrap"><div class="post__bio"><h3 class="u-h5"><a href="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/authors/katie-parker/" class="inverse" title="Katie Parker">Katie Parker</a></h3></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/orange-creamsicle-cookies-from-heaven/" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/media/posts/6/responsive/DSC_0008-605x756-xs.jpg" data-srcset="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/media/posts/6/responsive/DSC_0008-605x756-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt=""><div class="post__nav__text">Previous Post<h5>ORANGE CREAMSICLE COOKIES FROM HEAVEN</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/ultimate-peanut-butter-cookies/" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="post__nav__text">Next Post<h5>ULTIMATE PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES</h5></div><img class="lazyload" src="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/media/posts/3/responsive/DSC_0128-2-xs.jpg" data-srcset="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/media/posts/3/responsive/DSC_0128-2-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt=""></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/katiejoparker/" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/katiejoparker4/" aria-label="Pinterest"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Check out my Instagram for the latest and greatest.</p><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://katiejparker.github.io/potspansandparkers/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=3b94d4998f24c4cebb952de3a9b15b22"></script></body></html>
